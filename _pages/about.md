Welcome to my website! I am a Senior Research Advisor at the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca)'s International Economic Analysis department. I am also a Research Affiliate at the [CEPR](https://cepr.org).

Most of my work is in international macroeconomics and finance, on topics such as capital flows, exchange rates, monetary policy and shock transmission.
