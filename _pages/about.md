Welcome to my website! I am an Economic Advisor in the [Swiss National Bank](https://www.snb.ch/en/)'s International Monetary Cooperation division. I am also a Research Affiliate at the [CEPR](https://cepr.org).

Most of my work is in international macroeconomics and finance, on topics such as capital flows, exchange rates, monetary policy and shock transmission.
